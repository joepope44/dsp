# Learn command line

Please follow and complete the free online [Bash Scripting Tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/) or [Codecademy's Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line). These are helpful tutorials. You should be able to go through these in a couple of hours.

**Note:** Bash is not installed on a PC. Rather, PC users must install Cygwin. Once Cygwin has been installed, the command line interface witll _emulate_ bash. You can find all information regarding Cygwin [here](https://www.cygwin.com/).

### Q1.  Cheat Sheet of Commands  

Here's a list of items with which you should be familiar:  
* show current working directory path
* creating a directory
* deleting a directory
* creating a file using `touch` command
* deleting a file
* renaming a file
* listing hidden files
* copying a file from one directory to another

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do.  (Use the 8 items above and add a couple of your own.)  

pwd = show current working directory path 

mkdir = create a directory 

rm dir = delete a directory 

touch file.txt = creates a file 

rm file.txt = deletes a file

mv file1.txt file2.txt = renames file1 to file2 

ls -a = lists hidden files 

cp file.txt folder/file.txt = copies file from one directory to another 

man ls = the manual for the 'ls' command, aka help() 

rm dir -R = removes directory and its subdirectory and files 

### Q2.  List Files in Unix   

What do the following commands do:  
`ls`  
`ls -a`  
`ls -l`  
`ls -lh`  
`ls -lah`  
`ls -t`  
`ls -Glp`  

ls = lists files 

ls -a = list all files, including hidden files 

ls -l = list all, long format 

ls -lh = list files with byte, Kilobyte format 

ls -lah =  lists all files with byte, Kilobyte suffix format 

ls -t = list files, sorted by time modified 

ls -Glp = list files in colorized output, long form, with slash if object is a directory

### Q3.  More List Files in Unix  

Explore these other [ls options](http://www.techonthenet.com/unix/basic/ls.php) and pick 5 of your favorites:

ls -c = display files by timestamp 
ls -d = only directories 
ls -R = includes subdirectories 
ls -u = display by file access time 
ls -m = displays in csv format

### Q4.  Xargs   

What does `xargs` do? Give an example of how to use it.

xargs builds and executes command lines from standard input. Seems somewhat similiar to lambda in python. 

$echo 'one two three' | xargs mkdir

This line creates three folders (labeled one, two and three) using the 'mkdir' function
